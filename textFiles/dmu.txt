******* WHAT IS MISSING FROM SCHEMA TO SERVE INFINITE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS?? ******

- how does it work, technically? Be detailed
    4 tables (entities)
        - Activity
            Things that occur on a date
            Things user register for
        - User
            Abstracts different system users
            - Role attribute
                Admin
                Staff
                Student
        - Registration
        - Teacher
            (Will get signed in as Staff)
            Won't really have any registrations
            Decouples teacher from user accounts
        
    *** Do we need a "schools" table? ***
    *** Put "changed_by" in the registration table? 
            No, change relationship between user/registration for Participation
                Add Teacher/Registration relationship for Registered ***
    *** Attendance attribute is in registration ***

    Many-To-Many Relationships
        - Activity and User through Registration
           ____________          ________________          ________
           | Activity | ---<>--- | Registration | ---<>--- | User | ---- (role) --> Admin
           ____________          ________________          ________                 Staff
                                                             |                      Student
                                                             <>
                                                             |
                                                         ___________     
                                                         | Teacher |
                                                         ___________
