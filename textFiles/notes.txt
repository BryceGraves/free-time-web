Yong notes about site:

"buy now button is weird, not shopping for shoes."
    - More clear call to action
Ideally more information ABOVE the fold
    - Value proposition missing
        - knowing where students are
        - able to improve student learning
remove decade payment option
Most important thing: Content to present to the user that confirms they got
    what they payed for (email with temporary credentials, landing page for the site)
    - You took their money, give them their shit [MOCK THIS]

Yong notes about pitch deck:

Bullet points = DEATH

Slides are background: What speaker says is not what the slide says. Slides
    support the speaker.
    Break down slides so that they are smaller. More concise information.

    Add a slide that teaches the audience about what flex time is and what the 
    problem is.
    
"Why" is missing from the first page
    Education is changing
    Impossible to provide intervention support without Flex Time.
        Use interview with Stephen as example.
        Flex time is hard to track
        Student who need help can get, others can do exploratory learning
        Problem is that this scheduling is hard to manage
    One slide would be "Flex time scheduling is hard to manage" (is this the key problem?)
        Schools who try to do find administrative overhead to be to high, so they scrap it
        Knowing where students are is difficult without student tracking
        Solutions such as Google Docs did not alleviate the problem
