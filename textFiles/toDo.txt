Objectives to complete in order to finish pitch deck

- Improve Competitive Advantage
    - Focusing on UX is a problem - EVERYONE did it, and this is a RED FLAG!
    

"What we need"
    - to go from 10 customers (you can do this now) to 101 customers
    - How much time do we need? Let's bring it down from 2 years to 6 months?

- Add testimonial from Stephen Duval
    - "This product has increased productivity. What took teachers 20 minutes a week,
        and myself 60 minutes every week with a daily reset, has been reduced to only
        5 minutes each per week! Allows for fast 'response-to-intervention' to assist
        with student academic standing."
        - Ask Yong if we can make a composite testimonial like this.
- Calculate Total Addressable Market
    - 98,277 total schools * $1,000/year
    - $98,000,000/year
- Figure out how to calculate Total Serviceable Market
    - Bottom-up approach
    - https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=84
    - TSM = (Total # of Accounts) x (Annual Contract Value [ACV])
    - TSM = (~13,000 [in 2006]) x ($1000/year)
    - TSM = $13,000,000 annually
    - This TSM is based off ALL potential Middle Schools purchasing this product.
        This is includes middles schools that may not yet have flex time at their 
        school.
        Obviously not every account can be claimed, but I think the point is to just
        see the whole market?
- Figure out how to calculate Target Market
    - This should be schools that already use flex time
        - I cannot find a specific number, so lets say 20% of schools use flex time
    - TM = (13,000 * .20) x ($1000/year)
    - TM = $2,600,000
- Calculate how much money we need to ask for
    - How much does it cost to rent space?
        https://bendtech.com/office-desk-space-rent/
        BendTECH dedicated desk $250 a month / $9,000 for 3 dedicated desks for 1 year
        Dedicated office space starts at $600 a month
    - How much does it cost to run a server?
        https://www.inmotionhosting.com/cloud-application-platform
        $69 a month / $832.08 for 1 year
    - Total amount to ask:
        Advance for 2 years:
            9,000 x 2 (3 desks, 2 years)             18,000
            832.08 x 2 (server 2 years)              1,664.16
            ________________________________________________
            Total                                    20,000
